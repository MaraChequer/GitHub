####Activity 1.2: Personal Biography (graded)

Read a few of the links below to learn how to write a professional biography. You are asked to introduce yourself further by writing a one paragraph professional biography about yourself. This activity will help develop succinct and captivating writing and we will get to know one another better. For this week, you will upload your professional biography to a discussion forum so that we all can view and comment on each other’s biography. You will transfer your biography over to your e-portfolio, after you set that up next unit.

Here are a few resources about how to write a professional biography that may be helpful but feel free to write it in your own unique way. It may be helpful to put yourself in a real or hypothetical context that you are writing this biography for, for example, a speaking engagement (specific topic), a counseling practice, author of a book, etc. Have fun with this\!
