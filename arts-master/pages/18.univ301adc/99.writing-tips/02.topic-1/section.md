## Topic 1: Bias-Free Writing

Our first writing focus is on bias.

Be on guard for these types of bias in writing and speaking:

-   **Age:** Avoid derogatory or condescending terms associated with age.
    "Little old lady" can be rephrased as "a woman in her 80s," while an
    "immature adolescent" is better described as a "teenager" or "teen."

-   **Politics:** In any election campaign, words referring to politics are full
    of connotations. Consider, for instance, how the word "liberal" has been
    used with positive or negative connotations in various election campaigns.
    Take care with words and phrases like "radical," "left-wing," and
    "right-wing." Consider how your readers are expected to interpret these
    biased words.

-   **Religion:** Some older encyclopedia editions referred to "devout
    Catholics" and "fanatical Muslims." Newer editions refer to both Catholics
    and Muslims as "devout," thus eliminating biased language. 

-   **Health and abilities:** Avoid phrases like "confined to a wheelchair" and
    "victim" (of a disease), so as not to focus on differences and disability.
    Instead, write or say "someone who uses a wheelchair" and "a person with (a
    disease)."
