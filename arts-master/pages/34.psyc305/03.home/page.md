## Welcome to PSYC 305 - Abnormal Psychology

!!!! My name is **Carol Molcar** and I will be your Instructor for this course. I’m looking forward to exploring the fascinating field of Abnormal Psychology with you. We will look at the misconceptions people often have about mental illness and how attitudes and understandings have changed throughout history. We will also explore how mental disorders are diagnosed and treated. This is a field that I am especially interested in as a counselor for over 25 years (Licensed Mental Health Counselor in Washington state), a supervisor of many Master’s level counselors through the years, and from my Ph.D. studies in Clinical Psychology. I also have studied Christian theology (MATS) and have a special interest in the integration of psychology and spirituality. When I’m not teaching, I enjoy spending time with my husband and our 15 animals on our farm and experiencing the wonder of God’s beautiful creation. I especially love the blessing of getting to know you and encouraging you in your interest of Psychology. Again, Welcome!
