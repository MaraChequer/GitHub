### Participation (5%)

Active participation in our Zoom classes as well as Forums will greatly enhance our experience as a learning community. While we may differ in our views during discussions, all comments should be encouraging and “kindly” in order to create a safe space for open discussion.

#### Discussion Posts

Discussions are an important part of this online course. Most discussion postings should be no more than 300 words using full sentences and paragraphs. All postings should be carefully written and edited before being posted. Opinions should be well supported and cited according to APA 7th edition guidelines. Your responses should also be communicated in professional language, respectful of others, and to the point.

**Threading**

Be careful to thread your messages properly. Please begin your post with a colleague’s name where applicable. Post below the subject to which you are responding and have the subject line accurately reflect the post. If there is not a thread up at the time you would like to post, initiate a new thread and then post below it.

**Confidentiality**

Part of the value and richness of course dialogue is that learners share from their life/professional experiences to illustrate lessons they have learned. Please share discreetly and use pseudonyms when possible and necessary. Please do not share any confidential or proprietary information about your employer, colleagues, or students.

***Substantive participation/posting may include:***

- Providing a new thought, idea, or perspective;
- Citing an experience or example of what we are learning;
- Adding a new twist on a perspective;
- Critically thinking about an idea/concept;
- Questioning or challenging a principle/perspective.

***What Substantive Participation is NOT:***

- Very basic comments such as “I agree” or “I disagree;”
- Restating what has been said (unless there is a direct purpose in doing so);
- Disrespectfully disagreeing;
- Pat answers that are not thought-provoking or do not move the dialogue forward
