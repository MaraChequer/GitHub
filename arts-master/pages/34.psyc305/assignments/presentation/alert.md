### Presentation of a Well-known Person with a Mental Health Disorder: (10%) 

**Due May 17th** 

Your subject can be a current day well-known leader or celebrity or a historical figure with a known or suspected mental health disorder. In your presentation include a short biography of the person, how their disorder affected them, how they coped and perhaps, even in some way, how they  used their disorder to their benefit such as through their creativity. You may choose to research a person with the same disorder from the Chapter Summary which you presented in class.
