## **Unit 10: Other Powerful Formulae**

In this final unit of LDRS 220, are going to introduce a handful of additional formulae that can help a leader to better manage an organization.

First, we will explore the components that make up a Burdened Labor Rate. Many organizations consider this number based on "what the market will bear." For example, an auto shop may charge a ‘shop rate’ of $100/ hour; but if they are inefficient, then their true costs could be much higher. Of course, they are NOT paying $100/hour as a wage, but there are associated costs that could and should be added to the wage to accurately reflect the true cost of doing business.

Next, we will shift our attention to learning about estimating Standard Costing. There are a handful of items that constituent this formula, but for the most part, it can easily be said that goes beyond the costs of wages plus materials.

Finally, we will add to the Standard Costing to determine Utilization and Efficiency. Efficiency is mis-calculated at many organizations, resulting in an inaccuracy of the truth. The final step with these two numbers is to multiply them together to offer a true picture of organizational output, called ***Productivity.***
