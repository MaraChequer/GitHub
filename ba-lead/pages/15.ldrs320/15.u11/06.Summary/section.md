## Unit 11 Summary

In this unit, you have had the opportunity to learn that organizational culture is the set of values defining how and why members live at work. It is all the things that happen behind the scenes of the end products. Each organization’s culture has distinguishing characteristics that requires observing a range of values from the way people dress to the degree of cooperation and competition in the workplace.

These things are instilled through the workplace policies, social expectations, and company rules – spoken and unspoken.

We concluded the course by looking at the decision-making support and guidance offered by God as expressed in Proverbs, a book in the Bible.

In Unit one, you read the phrase: *Life is a journey, not a destination*, was made famous by Ralph Waldo Emerson. While we make a decision, the impact, the style, and the process is always evolving. We learn from our decisions; it will direct our next decision. Our view on ethics is framed by our scope and perspective on life. Our ideas and relationship with God is molded by our life events and our heart. *Life is a journey, not a destination.*
