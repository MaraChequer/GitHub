##  Introduction to Employee Engagement
&nbsp;

Creating a great workplace that can motivate employees who know how to do their best for the organization/company and serve customers right is one of the most important tasks for any organization/company dedicated to Transformational Servant Leadership practices.


It is common sense that enthusiastic and energetic employees feel better about their work and workplace; however, engagement is not determined only by the employee's subjective feelings. It is also about measuring employees’ satisfaction or happiness levels, as well as fulfillment of their wants and needs, and achieving the shared common goals of the organization/company.

Organizations have more success with engaged employees when they treat employees as stakeholders of the organization’s future. It means, for example, they focus on performance management activities, clarification of work expectations, supply resources to employees for getting jobs done properly, and promotion of positive work relationships and people development.


!!! Most of the U.S. workforce (51%) is not engaged, according to Gallup's State of the American Workplace report (2013). These employees are indifferent and neither like nor dislike their job. They represent a risk, and the risk could cause something significantly negative for the organization when the unwanted event happens.

For some employees who are not engaged, they need a reason to be inspired. They are the "show me" group that needs an extra push to motivate them. _Please refer to the following section for your understanding of “what is employee engagement” and “how to make employee engagement happen” for your organization._
