Employee Engagement will continue to be debated as to what it is exactly, how to develop it, and what impact it has in the workplace. Throughout this unit, you have seen how it is prudent for management and organizations at all levels to consider the needs of their employees, and that this increased focus on employee engagement has a significant impact not only on the wellbeing of employees, but also on the performance of organizations.
