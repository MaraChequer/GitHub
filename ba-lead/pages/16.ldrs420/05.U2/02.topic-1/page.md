## The 5th P of marketing
&nbsp;

As the world changes and businesses develop, there have been significant changes in the market and business / healthcare operations in recent years. A notable change is the structure and environment of organizations. As a result, the boundaries of the industry have been redrawn, which has not resulted in a clear definition for some industries.

Today's technology, such as the Internet, mobile phones, and constant access, has changed the way business is conducted, how communication occurs, and how decisions are made. Furthermore, in recent years it has been evident that with the economic crises and the recent health crises, organizations have been forced to adapt in order to survive the chaos.

Companies, have been affected by culture from the outside in, which has required leaders to reveal in a transparent manner what the organization believes. This transparent approach must be followed by adaptation of new strategies and thoughtful actions.

Clients, patients and consumers have also changed, and these changes have been accompanied by organizations that have adapted to these changes, and with some of the new communication channels it is evident that they are very different from the previous decade in many ways:

- They are far more educated and knowledgeable.
- They know what they want, they know what is available, and they know where to get it.
- They are more aggressive and assertive. much less passive.
They are more aware of their (purchasing) options, and power.

As a result, businesses and organizations are forced to be more creative and innovative to not only get the customer/patient but to keep them as loyal customers/patients. Traditionally, businesses have paid close attention to the Four “P”s of Marketing to earn and keep their fair share of the market. The four “P”s being:

- Product
- Place
- Promotion
- Price

### So... What is the fifth "P"?

With the fast-changing market, these are no longer adequate to run and grow a business. Ajit Rao, in his book, ”The Tao of Loyalty” (2006), suggests a critical fifth “P” - **People**, be added to the list, and that it needs to take precedence over the other four “P”s of marketing. As the world gets smaller, technology and innovation are now available to the masses.  Our people, our truly loyal employees, are the key for organization to distinguish themselves in the marketplace.

Rao suggests “great experiences” are now critical in building customer/patient loyalty. The other four “P”s may bring the customer/patient in, but it will be their experience that will keep them. This “great experience” cannot happen without highly committed and loyal employees and every level of the organization.

Keeping loyal employees requires understanding their needs and wants, setting targets, and measuring their engagement levels. Thus, customers, management, and the staff are all considered to be part of the People element.
