## The Tao of Loyalty
&nbsp;

An organization's key challenge is measuring, developing, and managing its employees' loyalty. "Employee loyalty" is composed of two key elements: Emotional and Behavioral. Often, it begins with a cognition of the organization's vision and mission.

**Emotional:** The employee’s attitude and psychological feeling towards the organization. (internal)

**Behavioral:** The employee’s actions and/or reactions to an object or event. (external)

This is where Rao introduces his concept of the Tao of Loyalty. The Tao is a school of Chinese philosophy that teaches that life is full of contradictions, such as male and female, hot and cold, soft and hard. It is through understanding these contradictions that one can better manage and respond to life. Employee engagement within organizations is an understanding of the contradiction between the emotional and behavioral aspects of loyalty. Using the Tao of Loyalty concept, Rao measures and manages the loyalty levels of their employees.

!!! “Those employees who feel emotional contentment in the workplace, feeling of doing one’s personal best to address the organization’s concerns as one’s own, a feeling of pride that the organization brings out the best in them as individuals as well as professionals, and are also willing to stay in the organization for longer periods of time” (Rao, 2006, p. 39)

### Emotional Loyalty Behavior

Employees who are emotionally loyal stay with an organization because they enjoy what they do, feel productive, and believe their workplace is a nurturing environment. Such a person will go out of their way to promote the organization as a great place to work and to attract customers/patients and other potential employees. Their commitment to the organization will make them a valuable employee and an effective marketer for the company.  

Non-loyal employees erode brand equity and drive customers/patients away. A front-line employee can have a significant impact on an organization's bottom line. They will leave the organization quickly and easily and they will strongly advocate to potential customers/patients and employees that the organization is a bad place to work.
