## Loyalty Segmentation
_Source: (Reading – Rao, 2006, p. 63) also read (Peters, 2019, pp. 33-35)_
&nbsp;

Emotional loyalty and the resulting behavior are a very powerful influence on an organization/business as well as an indicator of its health and its future potential. Consequently, an organization/business should be able to know what those indicators are and be able to measure employee loyalty.

Walker Information (1994) created a tool that measures the emotional and behavioral loyalty levels of employees in an organization and places them on a matrix that allows the organization to assess their overall employee loyalty.

Employees are placed in one of four quadrants:

1. High/High (I) -Truly Loyal: Happy, fulfilled, settled employees:
They are emotionally and behaviorally loyal to the organization. They come to work because they want to and desire to continue to work in the organization. They are very positive about the organization both internally and externally. The organization needs to have most of its employees in this quadrant.

2. High/Low (II) -Accessible: Value-seekers, opportunists’ employees:
They are emotionally loyal to the organization but in behavior, they are likely to leave shortly at the first chance for something perceived to be a better opportunity or with greater value to them. Some of it can be due to organizational issues, but most there are external influences.

3. Low/High (III) -Trapped: Unhappy, unmotivated, fearful employees:
They are not emotionally loyal to the organization, but they will not leave the organization. They usually are minimum contributors to the organization, to prevent being fired. They are not motivated or productive, are unhappy but will not move out due to fear. Fear of the unknown, change, loss of income, age considerations, debt load, etc. Their unhappiness, lack of motivation, and productivity cost the organization.

4. Low/Low (IV) -High Risk: Disillusioned, already gone in their heads.  
They are not emotionally loyal to the organization and have no desire to stay. The organization has disillusioned them and they are ready to leave at any moment. It is a high-risk for them to leave, as well as a high-risk for the company while they are still working there.

Segmenting customers in this way is very practical and flexible. To improve business performance in each of these quadrants, specific action plans can be developed.
