The construct of employee engagement consists of personal and professional components (Truss, Delbridge, Alfes, Shantz, Soane, 2014). A combination of "job satisfaction, job involvement, and affective organizational commitment" (Newman et al., 2010). Despite relational contexts being undervalued in employee engagement practices, employee engagement thrives in some relationships and wilts in others. “Relationships affect how work gets done –how individuals and teams coordinate, share knowledge, and accomplish tasks” (Bechky, 2006, as cited in Truss et.al., 2014).

The relational dimensions of personal engagement at work include meaningfulness (deepened purposes and heightened belongingness), safety (holding environments and group patterns of interaction), and availability (energizing and high-quality connections and interactions, emotional relief, and depletion (to feel for themselves and others).

Truss et.al. (2014) also point out that three constructs are highly associated with employee engagement: engagement, burnout, and workaholism. In Schaufeli's study (2008), he showed that rather than being three of a kind, workaholism, burnout, and engagement are three different types of employee well-being factors.
