!!! Background: Schaufeli, Bakker and Salanova developed a questionnaire to measure work engagement, the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES). The 20 questions that follow are based on their three aspects of engagement: Vigor, dedication, and absorption.


&nbsp;

### How engaged do you feel in your current job?

&nbsp;

:fa-pencil: Now, you will reflect about the following items and rate yourself out of 10 on each of the following criteria.  Make notes on these and your total score to discuss during session.

- Energy score
- Dedication score
- Flow score



&nbsp;

1. **Energy:** How energetic are you at work, are you willing to put in a lot of effort, and do you persevere in the face of obstacles?

&nbsp;

2. **Dedication:** Do you feel your work is important and meaningful, are you proud of your job, do you have a sense of responsibility, and do you feel inspired and challenged by it?

&nbsp;

3. **Flow:** Do you find it difficult to tear yourself away from your work when you are totally engrossed in it? (Timing passes quickly and you forget everything else around you).
