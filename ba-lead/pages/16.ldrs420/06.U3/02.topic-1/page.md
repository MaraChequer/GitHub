## Tao of Loyalty Concepts and Employee Loyalty
&nbsp;

As per the perspective of positive psychology, employee engagement can be measured through ways that enable employees to bring more positive psychological resources to work, such as several forms of collective meaning-making communication, managerial communication, collegial communication, and the ability to find benefits; in other words, rather than measuring individual engagement as an asset to be built up and then utilized.

Using a management grid, Rao (2006) measures how tasks and people are prioritized in an organization, unit, manager, and employee. Two distinct buckets are measured: the Task Bucket and the People Bucket. A high score in the Task Bucket indicates a positive working environment that enhances current productivity. In the People Bucket, high scores indicate that there is an environment that fosters teamwork, innovation, learning, and long-term productivity. Ten of the eleven Tao factors fall into those two buckets or the Yin and Yang of Loyalty Tao. The eleventh factor, communication, is critical to the success of both buckets. In order for an organization to score highly in both categories, there must be strong communication channels from the top down, from the bottom up, and laterally (sideways).

The top-down or bottom-up approaches are associated with the archaic and ineffective "hierarchical" model of leadership. The point remains that an open, transparent, and receptive culture is fundamental to the creation and maintenance of high employee loyalty.

### The Task Bucket and the Hard Factors

The Task bucket contains all the “hard” or “tangible” factors. These are the factors that develop a production-focused employee. An organization that manages the hard factors well creates employees that are “ready to be productive in the immediate present.

In the Tao of Loyalty book, Rao (2006) points out the five “hard or tangible” factors that are: Job Satisfaction, Role Clarity, Buy-into Vision/Mission/Values, Resources, and Accomplishments. An employee who scores high with task factors feels they are in the right job, know what is expected of them, have adequate resources to deliver the desired results, is inspired by the organization’s vision/mission, and feels a sense of accomplishment in their role within the organization.

In keeping with Rao’s Tao of Loyalty concept, the hard task factors are the Yang of Employee Loyalty. To have high-task orientation in an organization is necessary, but it is not enough to build high levels of loyalty. The organization must also be balanced with the soft people factors or the Ying of Employee Loyalty.

###The People  Bucket and the Soft Factors
In the People bucket are all the "soft" or "intangible" elements, which are more difficult to measure and manage. An organization that manages "soft" factors well creates a positive and nurturing work environment for its employees. In addition, these factors allow an employee to be nurtured and developed so that they will be productive in the future.

The five “soft or intangible” factors are:
- Appreciation
- Value
- Fairness
- Trust
- Care
- Concern

An employee who performs well on the people factors feels that they have been treated fairly and that the organization cares overall. The employees feel appreciated and have a sense of trust with the people at every level of the organization, and their ideas or suggestions are taken seriously.

An environment where employees feel safe and nurtured is created through the management of soft factors. Since they feel empowered, supported and encouraged, they are more likely to take risks and be innovative and creative. The right type of environment will not lead to employee burnout, ensuring long-term productivity.
