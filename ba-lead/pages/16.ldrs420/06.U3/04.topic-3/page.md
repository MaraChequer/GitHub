## Quality of Work Life: The Determinants of Job Satisfaction and Job Retention
&nbsp;

In terms of work life, how can quality be defined?  Whether an organization succeeds is largely dictated by its ability to recruit, motivate, and retain its employees. Modern organizations must be flexible so that they can develop their employees and enjoy their commitments. A strategy to enhance employees' quality of work life (QWL) is necessary to satisfy both organizational objectives and employee needs.

Quality of Work Life (QWL) programs in an organization are designed to improve the work environment for all employees. As a result, QWL targets improving human satisfaction, productivity, adaptability, and effectiveness in organizations.

Human factors include technological, human, societal, and organizational factors (factors of the workplace). QWL combines these factors to maximize performance.

### Job satisfaction and employee retention

Retention of employees can be predicted by employee satisfaction. It has been shown that worker satisfaction improves when employers take steps to foster strong relationships because workers believe their skills are being utilized and that their service is being appreciated. Consequently, the level of worker satisfaction tends to increase with higher employee retention.
