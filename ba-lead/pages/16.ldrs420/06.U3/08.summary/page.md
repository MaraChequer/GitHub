This unit connects the concepts of measuring employee engagement that we learned in Unit 1 and 2 with employee loyalty. Our primary focus is Tao's Employee Loyalty Model. The task and people buckets or measuring performance outcomes will not be enough to change the culture or properly address the issues associated with Employee Loyalty. Rao (2006) and Blake and Mouton (1985) proposed that the Ying and Yang of Employee Loyalty is made up of soft and hard factors.

Moreover, Rao covers each of the hard or tangible Task Factors in Chapter Six of his book, as well as the soft or intangible People Factors: Fairness, Care and Concern, Appreciation, Being Values, Trust in Chapter Seven. According to Rao's (2006) framework, the ten Task and People Factors, rooted in the 11th Communication Factor, are what lead to high employee engagement and loyalty in an organization. Additionally, they will offer effective and efficient customer service to organizations, as stated by Peters (2019).

As Parveen et al. (2017) and Sabbagha et al. (2018) have shown, employee engagement and performance outcomes are linked. Rao's findings are consistent with Blake and Mouton's findings. Performance outcomes are strongly related to the Quality of Life at Work (QWL) that employees experience on a daily basis. A company's performance outcomes, job satisfaction, retention, employee motivation, and their relationship within the company are all tied to engagement and loyalty.
