## MBS Leadership Team
&nbsp;

In an organization, MBS represents managers, bosses, and supervisors. From the very top, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). It is the CEO and team's responsibility to build the company's vision and mission.

&nbsp;

The company's purpose and direction (roadmap) are established in three ways:

1. Define and establish a clear Vision/Mission and align the organization to its Vision/Mission/Purpose. In doing so, the leadership produces four positive outcomes for the organization and its employees;
- Focus & direction in an ever-changing environment;
- Proactive & Accomplishment towards achieving the purpose;
- Teamwork & Relationships going the same direction for the a common cause;
- Constancy in how it manages both external and internal change.

&nbsp;

2. Identify and manage the core values of the organization. The values determine the way Business/Industry is conducted within the organization on a day-to-day basis, both internally and externally. They guide the practices that ensure the eleven factors are practiced and maintained. They ensure that all processes and policies are aligned with the values of the organization. These values can be placed into two categories:
- **Organic Values:** which are the principles and or philosophies that guide the way in which the organization’s purpose will be met. These values never change.
- **Operating Values** which define the way the organization will operate in the current business environment. These values can change when necessary.

&nbsp;

3.   Serve as Inspiring Role Models. Essentially the leadership practices what they preach, and live out in themselves what they expect of their organization and employees. They set the example for the team to follow. The ultimate goal of the MBS is to ensure that every person is giving their best in their job and to the organization. They do this in a number of ways, the following are some of them:

- Provide job clarity and clear expectations.
- Remove any barriers to success for each employee.
- Provides coaching to improve job satisfaction and sense of accomplishment.
- Shows regular recognition and appreciation.
- Look for and provide opportunities for individual development.
- Clear communication conduit to and from the Organizational Leadership.
- Lead by example.

The HR department for organizations plays an important role as well although they are not traditionally considered as a part of MBS; however, they are important to support MBS to implement their functions for organizations. In general, the HR Department for any organization has **five critical roles** to play creating high employee engagement/loyalty.

- HR creates its operational structure and ensures that the overall organizational structure is completely aligned to the purpose of the organization.
- HR ensures that all organizational and HR policies and procedures are in sync with the organization’s values, and that those policies are understood and practiced at all levels in the organization.
- HR provides training, mentoring and ongoing support for the managers and employees in keeping with the organizational Mission/Vision/Purpose and Values, and insuring that the important factors, such as Rao’s eleven factors, are practiced and experienced.
- HR facilitates the organization to form a culture aligned with the vision/purpose/values of the organization.
- HR is responsible for the outcome measurement process for the organization to ensure the outcome measurement process (for example, employee performance outcome) is implemented according to the mission/purpose/values of the organization.
