The success of any organization and its employee engagement ultimately hinges on those who lead and manage the team/company/organization. In this unit, the definition of MBS and their functions are clearly defined and discussed in Topic 1 and Topic 2. The identification and declaration of an organizationâ€™s mission/values/purpose is not enough.

 The leadership team of any organization must embrace, encourage, and model to their employees within the organization and to the key external stakeholders that include the customer, investors, suppliers, and community at large. In addition, the HR for organizations plays a critical role to ensure the functions of the leadership team can be implemented for effective employee engagement/loyalty/culture for the organization. As a potential TSL leader, your leadership skills can be practiced at any level regardless of the title you have. They are important skills to have because a good leader can bring out the best abilities in his/her team members and motivate them to work together in achieving a shared goal. The outcome of good leadership generates positive and meaningful employee engagement and corporate culture for all employees and the organization.
