## The RESPECT model for leadership
&nbsp;

!!! Dr. Marciano (2010) states, Great leaders create compelling visions and inspire others to give high levels of discretionary effort to support that vision. Powerful leaders are powerful because they invoke strong followership. The single most important factor in a leader’s ability to engage others is the extent to  he/she treats followers with RESPECT. Followers who do not feel respected will rarely give more than the minimum necessary effort to meet expectations and collect their paycheck. No leader ever accomplished great things without the support of loyal and dedicated followers – and you only get such support when you treat others with RESPECT!

&nbsp;

For the leader the seven drivers of respect look as follows:

**Recognition:** Recognizes, acknowledges, and shows appreciation for others’ efforts and contributions

  - Regularly takes the time to let others know that their work is appreciated.

  - Makes sure that others get the credit they deserve.

  - Recognizes and rewards others based on their job performance.

  - Frequently gives “pats on the back” for a job well done.
