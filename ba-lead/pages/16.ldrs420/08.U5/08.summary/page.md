Marciano (2010) and the textbooks by Bridger (chapter 2) and Peters (chapter 6) all indicate that there are two fundamental and different approaches to getting respect at the workplace. The first is through the use of fear and intimidation, which often involves control and manipulation. The second approach is through an attitude and actions that value and inspire the followers. They engage the heart and mind of the people (employees) around them. The readings for this Unit focus on the second approach. In addition, the term in leadership uses “transactional leadership” to name the first approach in getting respect at work. In MA in leadership, we use “servant leadership” or “transformational servant leadership” for the second approach. You can test both approaches for respect at work when you have time to do so.
