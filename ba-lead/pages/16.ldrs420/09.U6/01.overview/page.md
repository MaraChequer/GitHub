## Overview
In this unit we will consider the concept of stewardship as it pertains to employee engagement in business.  Resources will include Block’s (2013) Stewardship: Choosing Service Over Self-Interest and scholarly articles from Boon (2018), Chrisman (2019), Cunha et al. (2021), as well as Schillemans and Bjurstrøm (2020).

As 1 Peter 4:10 reminds us, “As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God's varied grace” (ESV).  It is by God’s varied grace we have our roles, responsibilities, gifts, and talents; we are to use these to serve those entrusted into our care.  Acts 20:35 clearly states “we must help the weak” (ESV).  Block (2013) delves into how we can help the weak, those with less power, by choosing service over self-interest and doing the emotional work of stewardship.     


This unit is divided into the following topics:
1. Choosing Service over Self-Interest;
2. The Emotional Work of Stewardship;
3. Principles for the Practice of Stewardship.
