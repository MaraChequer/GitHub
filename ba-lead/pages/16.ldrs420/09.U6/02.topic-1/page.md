## Choosing Stewardship over Self-Interest
&nbsp;

**Defining Stewardship**
Block (2013) defines stewardship “as the choice to preside over the orderly distribution of power...giving people at the bottom and the boundaries of the organization choice over how to serve a customer, a citizen, a community...the willingness to be accountable for the well-being of the larger organization by operating in service, rather than in control, of those around us.  Stated simply, it is accountability without control or compliance” (p. xxiv).

Here are other perspectives:

- Those who practice stewardship will align their interests with their organization (Chrisman, 2019).
- Stewardship is based on trust-inducing collaborative relationships (Schillemans & Bjurstrøm, 2020).


Throughout Units 6 - 10, I, as the course designer for the second part of the course for the business stream, will be entering a collaborative relationship with you as the student, by giving real-life examples from my own experience.  My name is Hyne-Ju Huizenga and I recently retired from business management in 2018, having started my career in 1990.  My main responsibilities during this time were operations, marketing, and change management, and stewardship was the foundation of my business management, aligning my interests with those of my organization.

In 1990, when I first became a manager, I did not want to follow the traditional management practice of dictating orders to the staff.  Instead, I thought back to when I was a staff member and how I would have wanted my managers to treat me.  Therefore, I asked the staff members on my shifts how best we could accomplish tasks together in the best interest of our organization, as Block (2013) reminds us, by operating in service and not in our individual self-interests.

At first, my staff were surprised I would want to give them some say in how to do things.  As a result of allowing them to express their perspectives and ideas, they were able to let me know what was needed in a given shift and held themselves accountable for their performance.  I provided guidance and kept them focused on serving the customer as the first priority and together we met our organization’s expectations for our shift.  We did this collaboratively, in a relationship built on mutual trust and accountability, being good stewards of the resources, including time, that was entrusted to us by our organization.  

The actions I took in 1990 were considered revolutionary and I received much criticism from other managers. Nevertheless, I did not use my position to grant myself privileged status over others.  Instead, by allowing my staff choice in the process of fulfilling organizational objectives, they brought more of themselves to the tasks, and work became more than a necessary evil to receive a paycheck.
