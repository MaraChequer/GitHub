## The Emotional Work of Stewardship
&nbsp;

**Stewardship Requires Faith**

Block (2013) explains we need “a certain kind of faith in ourselves and others not to make control the centerpiece of our transaction with the world.  We have come to believe that control is essential to our survival and safety, and even our success...Stewardship is the choice to unravel this connection between control, safety, and success.  The radical intent of stewardship is to be of service and to be accountable without having to be in charge.  Unraveling control, safety, and success is essential to discovering what is possible for us and our workplace” (p. 88).  Stewardship is a process of unraveling that requires emotional work.

**Aspects of the Emotional Work**
Those who practice stewardship are intrinsically motivated to do a good job (Boon, 2018).

!!! “In fact, stewardship implies ongoing negotiation of contested outlooks and priorities. Negotiation concerning stewardship issues calls for patience and mutual respect” (Cunha et al., 2021, p. 256).

Business management operations require a strict focus on task accomplishment within a given timeframe.  There were times when my staff did not understand this organizational priority, and I had to negotiate patiently and with mutual respect.  It may seem as a waste of time to traditional managers as there was so much to do, but I saw it as doing the hard work on the front end, so that we could align our actions with organizational objectives and have a better shift on the back end.

Engaging in dialogue and negotiations with the people entrusted to our care requires faith in their willingness to collaborate.  As a leader, this faith in both ourselves and our people is a necessary part of the practice of stewardship.  Unlike traditional management that seeks to control and micromanage, stewardship has us confident in our abilities to contribute to organizational interests, thereby ensuring safety and success.  

Not everyone may be ready to embark on this stewardship journey; there will always be those who want someone to tell them what to do so that they do not have to do any thinking.  We live in a broken world full of people with unstated emotional needs.  As stewards, we can be the kind of mentors who enable our employees to live up to their full potential.
