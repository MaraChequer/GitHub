## Principles for the Practice of Stewardship
&nbsp;

**The Redistribution of Power, Purpose, & Wealth**

Stewardship is a way to use power to serve through the practice of partnership and empowerment. This is the alternative to the conventional notions of “strong leadership” for implementing changes.  The intent is to redesign the governance of our organizations so that service is the centerpiece and ownership, and responsibility are strongly felt among those closest to the action: doing the work and contacting customers (Block, 2013).

Principle #1 Maximize the Choice for Those Closest to the Work
Principle #2 Reintegrate Managing and Doing the Work
Principle #3 Let Measurements and Controls Serve the Core Workers
Principle #4 Yield on Consistency across Groups; Support Local Solutions
Principle #5 Service Is Everything
Principle #6 Deglorify management as a job title and demystify staff functions
Principle #7 End Secrecy
Principle #8 Demand a Promise
Principle #9 Redistribute Wealth

It doesn't matter where a person works, whether it's in a low-paying sector or a high-profile position, they want to feel needed and like they're contributing to something bigger than themselves.  The contribution they make is therefore meaningful and gives them a sense of power.  As a society, we do not distribute wealth in an orderly manner. Professional sports figures make millions while school teachers earn average salaries.  Organizations adopting stewardship practices try to address this issue.

The nine above principles are a good place to start for an organization that is serious about distributing power, purpose, and wealth. Although tackling these principles together may not be easy, those united against the traditional patriarchal system designed to give the privileged most of the wealth will find themselves allies in the fight against injustice.  It seems only fitting that last principle #9 speaks to a redistribution of wealth.
