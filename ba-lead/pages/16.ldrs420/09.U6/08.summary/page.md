Stewardship means choosing service over self-interest and accountability without control or compliance.  Stewardship requires faith and its emotional work requires patience and mutual respect.  There are nine principles for the practice of stewardship including maximizing choice for those closest to the work, reintegrating managing and doing the work, measurements and controls serving the core workers, supporting local solutions, living out service being everything, demystifying staff functions, ending secrecy, demanding a promise, and redistributing wealth.
