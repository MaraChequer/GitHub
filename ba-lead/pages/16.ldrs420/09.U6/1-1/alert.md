:fa-book: Read Block (2013) Chapter 3 - 4, Chrisman (2019) & Schillemans & Bjurstrom (2020).

Block (2013) defines stewardship as a choice, and God has created us as human beings having agency, the ability to act on our awareness towards a chosen end.

Schillemans and Bjurstrømn (2020) discuss the balance between having agency, the awareness of our actions and choices, and stewardship, directing our actions and choices to better serve those entrusted to our care.   

Chrisman (2019) ponders on both the relevance and realism of practicing stewardship theory.  There are challenges to practicing stewardship, especially in a capitalist economy fueled by both individualism and materialism, where those that have the most can be likened to the ruling class in today’s society.
