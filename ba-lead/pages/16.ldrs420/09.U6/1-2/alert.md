:fa-book: Read Block (2013) Part 2 Case Study, Boon (2018), & Cunha et al. (2021).


Block (2013) explains the need to have faith in order to give up our need for control in order to practice stewardship.  The Christian worldview sees this as acknowledging the sovereignty of God the creator, and accepting that we are the created, obeying His call on our lives by exercising stewardship over all that He has entrusted to us, whether it be our individual bodies, careers, families, societies, even the Earth itself.

Using agency theory and stewardship theory as a juxtaposition, Boon (2018) provides a paradoxical perspective on stewardship. Cunha et al. (2021) provide a paradoxical perspective on stewardship as a process.
