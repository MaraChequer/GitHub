## Self-Efficacy


&nbsp;

### Introduction

The organizational climate and self-efficacy are important determinants of employee engagement.  Stanford University’s Bandura (1994) defined self-efficacy “as people's beliefs about their capabilities to produce designated levels of performance that exercise influence over events that affect their lives” while organizational climate considers “supervision, communication, and reward management” (Gautam & Kothari, 2021). As recorded in the Old Testament, Nehemiah demonstrated self-efficacy by managing the rebuilding of the wall of Jerusalem.  In order to create a conducive "organizational climate", Nehemiah first prayed and received the vision from God, surrendered to God's will, and fully relied on Him.  Only then did Nehemiah communicate with the Jews in Jerusalem, supervise their work, and manage their expectations, displaying courage and dealing with opposition, achieving results, and celebrating the great achievement with the people who had contributed to the great undertaking.

### Defining Self-Efficacy

“Self-efficacy beliefs determine how people feel, think, motivate themselves and behave” (Bandura, 1994).  When someone has a high self-efficacy, they engage in the different tasks at work by viewing them as challenges to be mastered.  Employees who are engaged show the traits of high self-efficacy when they set challenging goals, display a high level of commitment to their responsibilities and roles, and persevere in the face of setbacks and failures.

Someone with low self-efficacy views difficult tasks as threats to be avoided, may shy away from going beyond their job description, and may give up at the first sign of failure.
