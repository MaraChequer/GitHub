## Organizational Climate

Gautam and Kothari (2021) found that “responsible and involved employees work selflessly and always put organization’s interests on top” (p.63).  Positive organizational climates facilitate this and include:

1. Safety and Security
2. Meaningfulness
3. Social Support and the availability of Co-workers
4. Autonomy and Self-driven supervision
5. Learning Opportunities and Feedback
6. Situational factors including
  a) Supervisor Support
  b) Organization Support
  c) Procedural Justice
  d) Distributive Justice
  e) Job Characteristics
  f) Recognition and Reward

When organizations prioritize providing their employees with everything from safety and security to varied supports, the output from employees far outweigh organizational input costs.
