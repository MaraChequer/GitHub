## Talent Management
&nbsp;

Whereas determinants are determining factors, talent management factors are predictive factors that foretell, anticipate, and predict employee engagement levels.  The talent management factor that contributes the most to employee engagement is the talent recruitment process, followed by the training and development practices, and thirdly, the compensation practices (Abdullahi et al., 2021).

It is essential to understand the difference between Talent Management and Employee Engagement. Talent Management is the first step toward ensuring employee engagement, as managers must develop systems and make efforts to keep their staff engaged. Creating and nurturing better relationships with employees, letting employees demonstrate their skills, and not micromanaging are some of the talent management initiatives that allow an organization to retain their best workers.

There are many resources and perspectives out there that represent what Talent Management is facing in the modern work environment globally. Below is a video that illustrates one perspective. _(Please note that the video is 20 minutes long)_

Organizations must consider both the predictors and determinants of employee engagement.  On the Unit 7 assignment, you will be evaluating your own organization or an organization of your choice based on these factors.
