Employee engagement does not manifest itself from a vacuum; instead, Gautam and Kothari (2021) found organizational climate and self-efficacy are both determinants of employee engagement.  Bandura (1994) provides a definition of self-efficacy and Abdullahi et al. (2021) remind us that talent management plays a key role in employee engagement.  These lay the foundation for creating an environment where employees are motivated to perform at their very best because they have a belief in their own capabilities and work in a climate conducive to growth and development.
