## Overview
In this unit we will consider competitive strategies, including internal factors such as employee engagement, diversity, and inclusion to improve productivity and achieve both scale and market share.  Resources will include Beckham’s (2021) Competitive Strategy, Krithi and Pai’s (2020) Diversity and Inclusion: Key to Improve Productivity, and chapters 10 - 11 from Block (2013).

The story of Joshua and bringing down the walls of Jericho in the Old Testament give us an example of themes in this Unit and how God’s strategy is different from man’s strategies, or as Isaiah 55:8 reminds us, God’s ways are not man’s ways.  

Obeying God and engaging in His plans, in Joshua’s case, was a competitive strategy and it included diversity and inclusion into the tribes of Israel when Rahab and her family were spared for sheltering and aiding the spies Joshua had sent forth into Jericho.  Rahab’s actions improved Israel’s ability to be productive in conquering further territory in Canaan and grow their numbers and influence in the promised land (Joshua 5:13 - 6:27).



This unit is divided into the following topics:
1. Competitive Strategy to Gain Market Share;
2. Diversity and Inclusion to Improve Productivity;
3. Human Resources, Compensation, and Performance Evaluation.
