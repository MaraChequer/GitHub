## Competitive Strategy to Gain Market Share
&nbsp;

Beckham (2021) writes about both the development and analysis of strategy in our current competitive and constantly shifting organizational settings.  Beckham (2021) provides different tools for the analysis of both external and internal factors that companies operating today face.  Beckham’s (2021) main tool is the renown Porter’s Five Forces below, providing the foundation for competitive analysis.

1. Threat of New Entry
2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers
3. Bargaining Power of Customers
4. Threat of Substitutes
5. Rivalry Among Existing Competitors

Engaged employees are the secret weapon and competitive strategy for organizations to survive and thrive in a highly competitive global environment facing Porter’s Five Forces in today’s businesses.  In the highly competitive hospitality industry, my global brand went through several mergers and acquisitions to both thrive and survive.  Throughout all of them, we had to intentionally keep our staff top of mind, communicating with them and making information as transparent as possible to ease fears and deal with uncertainty.  Those organizations who can keep their employees engaged through difficult transitions will reap the reward of a more motivated workforce.
