## Diversity and Inclusion to Improve Productivity
&nbsp;

Today’s businesses face increased global competition and in order to scale and increase market share, they must adapt to modern approaches including diversity and inclusion to improve productivity.  Diversity provides different perspectives to generate creative solutions to overcome increasingly complex challenges.  Businesses need to build strategies to capitalize on the competitive advantage that diversity and inclusion bring to today’s organizations.

Krithi and Pai’s (2020) study focuses on the diversity from gender, disabilities, nationality, and persons from underprivileged societies.  To foster inclusion, Krithi and Pai (2020) suggest the following:

- Collaborations
- Barrier-free Infrastructures
- Barrier-free Communications
- Engagement
- Advocacy

Organizations today must consider diversity and inclusion, such as the above factors, to improve productivity for their businesses.  In the neighbourhoods with a large population of people from specific nationalities, my global brand practiced barrier-free communications by hiring people who did not speak English and paired them with someone who spoke their mother tongue.  The level of engagement in this practice was extremely high and both the community and our brand benefited.
