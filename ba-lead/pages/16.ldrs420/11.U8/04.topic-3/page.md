## Human Resources, Compensation, and Performance Evaluation
&nbsp;

The Human Resources (HR) department is integral to the success of the organization.  Block (2013) writes on how HR has been the institutional caretaker in the past and needs to take on a new purpose and role if we are to end the practice of paternalism.  Implementing Blockâ€™s (2013) vision requires a change in the structure of HR and an alignment with practices that support stewardship.

Essential in the support and pursuit of stewardship is the compensation and performance evaluation system.  Block (2013) makes the analogy of the past compensation system reinforcing class distinctions and the divine right of kings, calling for the overturning of the class system.  Block (2013) reminds us that performance should not be for sale, and we need to be aware of rank individualism, remembering to not confuse boss evaluations with performance.  Instead, Block (2013) suggests HR should strive to end the era of caretaking, provide pay for growing the organization, and create reward systems that support stewardship.

Spending almost thirty years in business management has let me have first-hand experience with the caretaking function of the Human Resources department.  Most of my staff preferred this caretaking and it would take a big shift in perspective for them to consider the stewardship model.  This shift in perspective must start with the leadership and the training and learning we afford our people when they initially join our organizations.
