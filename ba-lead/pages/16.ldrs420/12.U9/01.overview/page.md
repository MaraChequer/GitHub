## Overview
In this unit we will consider the concept of recognition and using it for engaging employees, retaining their talent, and accelerating their performance.  Then we will explore future business process management capabilities in today’s digital age.  We will also apply our learning to create a process and analysis tool for our own organizations.  Resources will include Gostick and Elton’s (2009) The Carrot Principle, as well as Kerpedzhiev et al.’s (2021) An Exploration into Future Business Process Management Capabilities in View of Digitalization.

Recognizing our people, building them up, and giving them leadership opportunities was played out in the Old Testament story of Moses taking his father-in-law Jethro’s advice.  Moses recognized able men among the Israelites who feared God, were trustworthy, and disdained dishonest gain.  By setting these men apart, he built them up in the eyes of the Israelites and then he gave them leadership positions.  

As Jethro advised, “Let them sit as judges for the people at all times; let them bring every important case to you, but decide every minor case themselves.  So it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you.  If you do this, and God so commands you, then you will be able to endure” (Exodus 18:22-23, NRSV).  By doing this, Moses had former slaves of Egypt take on positions of authority, essentially accelerating their performance as they boldly entered into God’s generous provision, a new age for the Israelites requiring new capabilities in the promised land.




This unit is divided into the following topics:
1. How to Effectively Use Recognition;
2. Future Business Process Management;
3. Process and Analysis Tools.
