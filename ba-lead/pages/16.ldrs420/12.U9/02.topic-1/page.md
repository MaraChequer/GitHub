## How to Effectively Use Recognition

Gostick and Elton (2009) consider the question on how the best leaders deliver extraordinary results.  They discover that the following basic four of leadership require the missing ingredient of recognition, which they call an accelerator, to produce extraordinary results.

2. Communication
3. Trust
4. Accountability

Recognizing their efforts when goals were achieved and organizational objectives met created a culture and environment that thrived in delivering extraordinary results.
