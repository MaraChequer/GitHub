## Future Business Process Management
&nbsp;

Business process management drives organizational success by implementing efficient and effective business processes, usually structured through capability frameworks such as those listed below.  Existing capability frameworks must consider socio-technical changes such as digitalization.

1) Strategic Alignment
2) Governance
3) Methods
4) Information Technology
5) People
6) Culture

The above are tried and true capabilities, and Kerpedzhiev et al. (2021) find todayâ€™s businesses need enhanced and even new capabilities to survive and thrive.  It is predicted that most of the jobs available in the next thirty years have not even been created yet.  To be good stewards of our organizations, we need to remain constantly aware of developing socio-technical changes that come our way.
