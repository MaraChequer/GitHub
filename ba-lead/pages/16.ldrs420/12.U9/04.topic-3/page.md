## Process and Analysis Tool
&nbsp;

Based on the content studied in this course, present a Process and Analysis Tool for “Employee Engagement and Stewardship” in an organization. You may choose to develop the proposal based on your current organization or a past organization you were involved with.

This tool should address three key areas:
1. Introduction – For new employees of the purpose, goals, and expectations of employee engagement in the organization.
2. Analysis Tool – To adequately measure and assess the engagement of the employee as well as the effectiveness of the organization's stewardship of said employee.
3. Policy & Practices – For addressing any identified concerns and the ongoing development of Employee Engagement for long-term sustainability.

The primary purpose of this assignment is for it to become a tool and a "working paper" for you to further develop and utilize within your own organization and leadership practices.  Throughout the Master of Arts in Leadership program, all your learning provides different tools for your toolbelt that you will be taking with you as you enter into the various marketplaces of life.
