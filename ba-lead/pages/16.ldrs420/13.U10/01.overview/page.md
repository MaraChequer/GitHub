## Overview
In this unit we will consider the stewardship steps required to reform organizations politically, as well as using corporate social responsibility to engage employees.  Finally, we will acknowledge the challenges posed by cynics, victims, and bystanders when attempting reforms for the common good.  Resources include Block’s (2013) Stewardship: Choosing Service Over Self-Interest and the scholarly article from Bernardino (2021).

The Bible gives us the example of Daniel and his three friends Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, choosing not to become cynics, victims, or bystanders when they were taken to the Kingdom of Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar and required to eat the meat and drink the wine from the king’s table which would defile them.  Instead, Daniel engaged the steward overseeing him and his friends and proposed the first controlled experiment.

“Please test us for ten days on a diet of vegetables and water,” Daniel said.  “At the end of the ten days, see how we look compared to the other young men who are eating the king’s food. Then make your decision in light of what you see.”  The attendant agreed to Daniel’s suggestion and tested them for ten days.
At the end of the ten days, Daniel and his three friends looked healthier and better nourished than the young men who had been eating the food assigned by the king.  So after that, the attendant fed them only vegetables instead of the food and wine provided for the others. (Daniel 1:12-16, NLT)
