## Stewardship Steps toward Political Reform
&nbsp;

The tactical stages of stewardship can be listed in the following nine steps toward political reform:

- Define the Stewardship Contract
- Renegotiate Control and Responsibility
- Fully Inform People
- Create a Desired Future
- Training
- Form Improvement Teams
- Change Management Practices
- Fit Architecture to Purpose
- Redesign the Reward System

As a business manager, I was responsible for training leaders for their various responsibilities.  For the remaining tactical stages of stewardship to fall into place, the training of our people is paramount for success.
