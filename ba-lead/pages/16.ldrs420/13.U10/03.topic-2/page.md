##  Engaging Employees through Corporate Social Responsibility
&nbsp;

Today’s employees want to contribute to organizations where they are learning, feel engaged, and have a greater sense of purpose by making a difference on both environmental and social issues.  Businesses practicing environmental and social stewardship benefit by having involved and aware employees (Bernardino, 2021).
Bernardino (2021) explores how an organization’s communication strategy, plan, and actions all align with corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs to bring about the results needed to keep employees engaged and gives the following examples and measures:

1. Examples of good CSR programs include employee engagement that:
2. Let employees choose causes to support.
3. Make it easy by giving them time to get involved such as volunteer days.
4. Get leaders buy in such as turning CSR actions into team building activities.
5. Partner with nonprofits for credibility.
6. Measures to determine whether CSR programs are engaging employees are:
7. Participation rate.
8. Increased participation rate.
9. Repeated participation.
10. Post event testimonials and comments.

Even if the cause that the employees choose to support is a canned food drive at the local elementary school, it has a better chance of being successful because they chose the cause.  Once the cause is chosen, the leaders of the organization must provide support and networking for sustained and continued participation.  When the entire organization is on board, the canned food drive at the elementary school can become a yearly Christmas event to feed the disadvantaged as it did for one of my business units in a Vancouver neighbourhood.
