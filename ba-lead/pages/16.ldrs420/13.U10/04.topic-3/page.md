## Cynics, Victims, and Bystanders
&nbsp;

Stewardship is an Exercise of Faith, Responsibility, & Commitment
Block (2013) explains the need for faith, responsibility and commitment to control the paralyzing three of:
1. Doubt
2. Helplessness
3. Indifference

That is spurred on by the cynic, victim, and bystander.

&nbsp;

### The Power of the Cynic

1. There is truth in what they say when reporting the way they have experienced events.
2. Cynic’s express everyone’s doubts, putting words to the doubts we all share.
3. Cynics put doubts and questions into the open, public settings, and for that we will never forgive them.

&nbsp;

### Why You Cannot Argue or Barter with Cynics
1. Because history is on their side, and they speak to our doubts.
2. The more you argue or barter with cynics, the stronger they become.
3. Cynicism is disbelief, a loss of faith in the sincerity or goodwill of others.

&nbsp;

### Cynics have Two First Cousins
1. Victims
2. Bystanders

&nbsp;

### Victims
1. Victims do not want to take responsibility. Power is what victims want, and we are the ones they want it from.
2. Victims believe that others, often us, hold the answer to their helplessness. If they were just given more power, or if our behavior would change in some way, then they would begin to take responsibility. In this way, victims profess the belief not only that the people on top do hold all the marbles but also that they should hold all the marbles.
3. Victims are strong believers in patriarchy; they are just angry that they are not the patriarchs. Victims do not want a change in the governance system; they just want a change in who governs.

&nbsp;

### Bystanders
1. Bystanders enter the game by withholding commitment.
2. They want proof that stewardship works.
3. Being a bystander is one more version of our wish for certainty and safety.

Block (2013) reminds us that we cannot choose adventure and then promise safety to get people to come with us.  As the saying goes, we can bring a horse to water but we cannot make it drink.  We must remember we cannot force anyone to do anything.  Instead, we can give them the choice to remain where they are or to reach within themselves to attain a bigger version of themselves.  As leaders, we can see more in our people than they may see in themselves.  Then as we see greatness in them, they may learn to find that greatness within themselves.
