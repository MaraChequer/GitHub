We considered the nine stewardship steps needed for political reform and using Corporate Social Responsibility to engage our employees.  Yet we need to remember Matthew 10:16 and be wise as serpents when encountering the cynics, victims, and bystanders who challenge attempted reforms for the common good.  Only when we are aware of what to expect can we stay innocent as doves in our attempts to transform our organizations, our people, and ourselves into good stewards of all God has entrusted to us.
