## Assignment 1: Organization Assessment according to the Eleven Tao Factors
_(Go to the bottom for the link to assignment submission)_

&nbsp;

### Objective:
This assignment will draw on Ajit Rao's research (book). You are to assess your organization according to the Eleven Tao Factors (drivers) & 87 questions on Appendix C (p. 241-248). For your convenience, you can find the file in the bottom of this page to download.

You may use the following points to outline your paper, which should be 6-8 pages (double spaced). For some sections, as is appropriate, bulleted points or charted data may be used.

Begin by briefly describing your organization as one would do on a website page "About Us". Describe your organization's Mission, Vision, and Core Values in a similar fashion as the Sarova Case Study (this week’s PPT slides).

Use Appendix C (pp. 241-248) to create a framework for the assessment of your organization. Use these three main sections and sub-headings.

### Part A: Task Factors (Yin)
1. Job satisfaction
2. Role clarity

### Part B: People Factors (Yang)
1. Fairness
2. Care and concern
3. Appreciation

### Part C: Communication
1. Devise a way to assess your organization according to these eleven attributes. You may wish to (a) rank them, or (b) use a high to low value on the presence of a particular criterion.

2. Identify which of these eleven factors currently contribute the most to your organization's level of loyalty.

3. Identify some current practices that need to change if employee loyalty is to improve.

4. Lastly, what two things can you implement immediately to improve employee engagement and thereby organizational performance?
