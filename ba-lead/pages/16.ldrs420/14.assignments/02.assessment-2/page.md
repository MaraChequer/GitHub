## Assignment 2: 	Real life reflective paper
&nbsp;

### Instructions:
Write about a situation (preferably real life) where you have experienced or are experiencing an employee or colleague who is “under-performing”. I suggest the following points to outline your paper, which should be 6-8 pages (double spaced).

1. Begin by profiling this individual in terms of their …
a. life situation: age and gender, relevant life circumstance (e.g. young family, etc.), and
b.  work situation: job title.

2. Describe the problem. In what ways are they underperforming? Substantiate your case study with details/examples of his/her performance.

3. Use Adam Grant’s Ted Talk’s categories (agreeable giver, agreeable taker, disagreeable giver, disagreeable taker) to identify what motivates them. Explain the rationale for the assigned label.

4. Use the RESPECT model & Recognition drivers & Crisis Management Framework to identify drivers that you perceive might be lacking if you want to build a culture of employee engagement.

5. Sum up the resulting challenges, including an evaluation of how much the situation may impact others in the organization or those on the team.

6. Address how you can approach the problem.
    a. Consider the timing of an intervention.
    b. As a servant leader and steward of the organization, discuss the situation in terms of potential discipline or termination of employment.
    c. How do your faith (or foundational core values) and servant leadership principles influence the action you would/will take with this employee?
