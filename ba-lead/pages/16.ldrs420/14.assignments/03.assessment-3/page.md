## Assignment 3: Process and Analysis Tool design

Based on the content studied in this course, design a Process and Analysis Tool for “Employee Engagement and Stewardship” in an organization. You may choose to develop the proposal based on your present organization or for a previous organization you were involved with.

&nbsp;

**This tool should address three key areas:**
1. Introduction ~ for new employees of the purpose, goals, and expectations of employee engagement in the organization.
2. Analysis Tool ~ to adequately measure and assess the engagement of the employee as well as the effectiveness of the organization's stewardship of said employee.
3. Policy & Practices ~ for addressing any identified concerns and the ongoing development of Employee Engagement for long-term sustainability.
The primary purpose of this assignment is for this to become a "working paper" for you to further develop and utilize within your organization and leadership practices.

&nbsp;

Your proposed "Process & Analysis Tool" should take into consideration all the key themes/focuses we have discussed throughout this course and should include the following info in your final assignment:

1. Introduction: To the organization being addressed.
This would be the same information you would give to your new employee. (You may reuse your information from Section 1 of your Assignment #2)

2. Purpose Statement: for the Process and Analysis Tool and the expected benefits and outcomes of its implementation within the organization.

3. Methodology and Process for the introduction. Take into consideration the timing as well. For example, when and how during the hiring process and orientation.

4. Methodology and Process for attaining the information. (i.e. surveys, interviews, feedback loops, follow-up, etc.)

5. Key Themes: List the key focuses to be addressed. (i.e. consider the key focuses in this course)

5. Methodology for Analysis:  learning from the information (i.e. appointed committee, forms, clearly laid out Employee Engagement policies and check-list, etc.)

6. Recommended Responses and Follow-up: to the concerns and shortcomings discovered through the analysis.

7. Recommended Policy and Practices for increasing and facilitating ongoing effective engagement and stewardship.

8. Conclusion: Why do you feel this Analysis Tool would be beneficial in your organization. How have servant leadership principles influenced your proposal?

**Important:** Provide support for your approach and reference it accordingly. Where possible, include any supporting materials in the appendix (i.e. copy of the proposed survey,  copy of  Employee Engagement Policies, check-list, etc.)

**Submission format:** The paper should be 10-12 pages, not including your references and appendix material.

&nbsp;

!!! The overall purpose of this final Assignment is to help you build a tool that can help you to intentionally apply what you have learned in this course towards becoming more effective in your leadership influence within your organization. This may be at a corporate level as you introduce this as a proposed company policy, or on a personal level as you apply it to your approach to employee engagement within your team.
