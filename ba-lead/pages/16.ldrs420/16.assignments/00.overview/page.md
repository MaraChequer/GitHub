### **Academic Integrity and Avoiding Plagiarism at TWU**

As scholars pursuing higher education, academic integrity is a core value of the entire TWU community. Students are invited into this scholarly culture and required to abide by the principles of sound academic scholarship at TWU. This includes, but is not limited to, avoiding all forms of plagiarism and cheating in scholarly work. TWU has a strict policy on plagiarism (see [policy below). Learning what constitutes plagiarism and avoiding it is the student's responsibility. Two resources describing plagiarism and how to avoid it have been prepared by TWU Librarian William Badke and are freely available for viewing [here](https://vimeo.com/163566887/bece097c99).

### Late Assignments Policy 

Assignments should be submitted on the due date in order to receive full credit. The penalty for unexcused late assignments will be determined by the following scale:

1. For each day or part thereof late, the instructor will reduce the assigned grade by one- third of a letter; e.g., “A” to “A-,” “B+” to “B.”
2. Requests for extensions **must be communicated in advance** of the due date. Special circumstances may warrant additional consideration.
