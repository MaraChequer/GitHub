# Unit 1: Defining Health and Healthcare

In this first unit, students will begin exploring some general concepts regarding health and healthcare. Exploring these topics will help students understand their own perspective on health and how they will approach the issues that we will be discussing in the coming weeks.

## Topics

This unit is divided into the following topics:

1. Defining Health
2. Defining Healthcare
3. Why should we care about health?
4. Servant Leadership in Healthcare
5. The MA Leadership Conceptual Paradigm

Note: This course has been designed for students to complete unit learning activities at home prior to attending learning lab sessions; however, students may not arrive at the first session prepared for group discussions. Please allow time for students to work on learning activities in class, then clarify that all future learning activities need to be completed at home in preparation for learning lab group discussions.

#### Facilitated Learning Lab Activity 1.1: Discussion

Explain what a [reflective learning journal](../00.reflective-journal) is. This journal is **not submitted or graded**, but is an opportunity for students to reflect on, and engage with, the course content. The questions posed in the learning activities will help them prepare for their assignments and are designed to help them successfully achieve the learning outcomes for each unit.

Next, separate students into small groups and ask them to define health as a group and discuss the assumptions that they have about what health is. Allow 10-15 minutes for this activity and then bring the groups back together and ask them to share their definitions.

#### Facilitated Learning Lab Activity 1.2: Video & Discussion

Show the video following video, "Healthcare: is it a right or a luxury?" by Tarik Sammour in learning activity 1.2.

Allow time for respectful discussion after the video and lead a large group discussion on whether or not students think healthcare is a right or a luxury.

#### Facilitated Learning Lab Activity 1.3: Why Healthcare is a Christian Issue.

Ask students to review the article "Why Healthcare is a Christian Issue" by Andrew Sumarsono (2020) and Dr. Strong's video clip on [A Biblical view of Health](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/0fcfbf5e-d2f3-4828-adfe-84b7f3687ff0). Then break students into small groups again to discuss the following questions:

1. How did you feel about what you read in Sumarsono's (2020) article and watched Dr. Strong's video, and why do you think you had this response?
2. What role do you believe faith has in your professional role in health care?
3. Why is healthcare an important issue for Christians?

Lead a group discussion using the questions above. Depending on your location, a Christian perspective may be new concepts for students. You have the freedom to take extra time to discuss this perspective in more depth. Encourage participants to share knowledge and application from personal experience wherever possible.

#### Facilitated Learning Lab Activity 1.4: MA Leadership Framework

Review the MA Leadership Framework with students and provide an overview of each of the competencies and the servant leadership characteristics.  It is important that students understand what each of these are, what the differences are between competencies and characteristics and how to integrate and apply these concepts throughout the course.

The basic premise of integration is to make connections across various disciplines to increase knowledge. This concept focuses on synthesizing, interpreting, and connecting various disciplines, courses, course content. Examples include the combination of two disciplines such as healthcare and leadership. In this course, an emphasis on integrating the MA Leadership competencies, Servant Leadership characteristics to the specific healthcare issues will be important.

Application means how knowledge can be applied to problems and issues in society. The purpose of this course is to explore the different healthcare leadership issues and it is important to have students identify solutions for problems that they will experience in healthcare. Boyer (1990) contends, “New intellectual understandings can arise out of the very act of application – whether in medical diagnosis, serving clients in psychotherapy, shaping public policy, creating architectural design, or working with the public schools” (p. 23). Application goes beyond academia and integrates knowledge from one's field to the community.

Depending on your location, transformational servant leadership principles may be new concepts for students. You have the freedom to take extra time to discuss these principles in more depth. Encourage participants to share knowledge and application from personal experience wherever possible.

### Assessment: Unit 1 Discussion Post 

Students should answer the questions provided in the Discussion Post Unit 1 in the Assessment section of the course site. They will share ideas during in-class discussion/presentation and summarize their learning by posting in the Unit 1 Forum Discussion in Moodle. It may be helpful to go over the expectations for the discussion post.  See Discussion Post and Responses assessment in the Moodle course.

### Participation

As the facilitator, please fill out a rubric for each student to let the instructor know about engagement and participation. This will be part of the student’s grade for this portion of the course.
