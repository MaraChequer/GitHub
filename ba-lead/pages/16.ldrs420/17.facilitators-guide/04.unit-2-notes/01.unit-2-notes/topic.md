# Unit 2: The Canadian Health Care System  

In this second unit of LDRS 631, we explore how Canada's health care system has been a work in progress since its inception. Reforms have been made over the past four decades and will continue in response to changes within medicine and throughout society. The basics, however, remain the same - universal coverage for medically necessary health care services provided on the basis of need, rather than the ability to pay. 

## Topics

This unit is divided into the following topics:

1.	The Canadian Health Care System

2.	Values in Canadian Health Care

3.	The Pro's and Con's of Medicare

#### Facilitated Learning Activity 2.1: Health care in Canada 

Start this learning activity by showing the following video [Canada's Healthcare System Explained!](https://youtu.be/1TPr3h-UDA0)

Break students up into small groups and have them discuss the following questions:

1. How do you think health care should be organized and governed in Canada?
2. Who do you think should be responsible for paying for healthcare services?  

#### Facilitated Learning Activity 2.2: Values in Canadian Healthcare

Review the following list of principles of Canadian healthcare with the students: [The Five Principles of Medicare](https://shpm.info.yorku.ca/the-five-principles-of-medicare/) 

Use the [1-2-4-All Liberating Structure](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/)

- Begin by asking students to silently self-reflect on the following questions (1 min.):
  - As a healthcare professional, what do you think should be the most important values of the health care system? Why?
  - As a healthcare system user/customer, what do you think should be the most important values of the health care system? Why? 
- Next, have the students share their thoughts on these questions in pairs, building on ideas from self-reflection. (2 min.)
- Next, group the students into foursomes and ask them to share their thoughts on the questions asking them to note similarities and differences. (4 min.)
- Finally, bring the whole group back together and ask, “What is one idea that stood out in your conversation?” Each group shares one important idea with all. (5 min.)

#### Facilitated Learning Lab Activity 2.3: Canada's Healthcare system: Achieving It's Potential

Start this learning activity by asking students to reflect on what they learned from Dr. Martin's article [“Canada's universal health-care system: Achieving its potential.”](https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(18)30181-8.pdf) Break the class back into the foursome from activity 2.2.

1. Ask students to identify and discuss two ideas that were new to them from the article.

2. Ask students to identify and discuss two barriers that health care leaders face in overseeing the delivery of health care service delivery in Canada.

### Assessment Unit 2: Discussion Post and Participation

Students should answer the questions provided in the Discussion Post Unit 2 in the Assessment section of the course site. They will share ideas during in-class discussions and summarize their learning by posting in the Unit 2 Forum Discussion in Moodle. It may be helpful to go over the expectations for the discussion post.  See Discussion Post and Responses assessment in the Moodle course.

### Participation

As the facilitator, please fill out a rubric for each student to let the instructor know about engagement and participation. This will be part of the student’s grade for this portion of the course.
