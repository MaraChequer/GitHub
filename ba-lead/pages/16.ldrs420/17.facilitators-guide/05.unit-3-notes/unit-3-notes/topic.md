# Unit 3: The Challenges of Health Care in Canada 

The need for healthcare reform in Canada is clear. A system once designed around acute care now has to treat a population that is living longer and experiencing increasingly complex chronic conditions. Despite many attempts at changing healthcare delivery in Canada’s provinces and territories, Canada continues to have one of the most expensive systems in the world, and yet its health outcomes are outpaced by many of its Western counterparts. This unit will address the challenges by analyzing the process of change to recommend ways forward for implementing, managing and assessing reforms in Canadian healthcare.


## Topics

This unit is divided into the following topics:

1. The Challenges of Health Care in Canada

2. Pressing Issues

3. Making Comparisons

#### Facilitated Learning Lab Activity 3.1: Six Big Ideas Video and Discussion

To begin this learning activity, show students the following video by Dr. Danielle Martin [Scaling Up](https://youtu.be/xa4PNZlmQSo) (video is 15 minutes long).

Next, break the class into 4-5 small groups.  And ask them to discuss the following questions:

1. What are the two recommendations that YOU think are most important for addressing the challenges of the current health care system(s) in Canada? 
2. Why do you think your recommendations are the most important?

#### Facilitated Learning Lab Activity 3.2: The Challenges Jigsaw

Please review the [<span class="underline">Jigsaw Method video</span>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euhtXUgBEts) in preparation for facilitating this activity. Students should come prepared with notes about their “expert group” topics to share during Round 1 of discussions. Substantive participation is encouraged. As the facilitator, please fill out a rubric for each student to let the instructor know about engagement and participation. This will be part of the student’s grade for this portion of the course.

Place students in expert groups before the session, and give them time to research and prepare for group discussion. After Round 1, place students in teaching groups so that one member of each expert group is represented in the new teaching groups. Students will summarize and disseminate information from Round 1 during Round 2. Each expert group will discussing the following challenges using the following guiding questions: 

1. Sustainability - Group 1

   If our population is aging, and the nature of disease and illness has changed, what do you think healthcare leaders should invest their time and resources in to help Canadians take better care of their health?

   What MA leadership competencies do you think would be needed to implement the changes necessary to make healthcare sustainable? 

2. Making Canadians Healthier - Group 2

   What do you think are the most significant barriers that healthcare leaders face in making people healthier?

   What MA leadership competencies do you think would be needed to implement the changes necessary to make Canadians healthier? 

3. Equity - Group 3

   How have you observed the impact of income on health?

   What do you think works and what doesn’t work with social assistance programs? 

   What MA leadership competencies do you think would be needed to implement the changes necessary to make healthcare more equitable? 

4. Access to Care - Group 4

5. Living without adequate access to healthcare services can be difficult, especially for people living with multiple or life-long chronic conditions. Do you know of a person in your life who has had difficulty accessing healthcare? How did it affect them? 

   Do you think Canada is should provide a universal healthcare coverage for more than just physician and hospital services? Why or why not?

   What MA leadership competencies do you think would be needed to implement the changes necessary to make healthcare more accessible? 

5. Comprehensiveness - Group 5

   Living without adequate drug coverage can be difficult, especially for people living with multiple or life-long chronic conditions. Do you know of a person in your life who has had difficulty paying for their medications? How did it affect them? 

   Canada’s lack of universal pharma coverage is considered “an accident of history.” What factors (e.g. political, scientific) do you think have contributed to this? 

   Do you think Canada is should provide a universal drug coverage plan? Why or why not?

   What MA leadership competencies do you think would be needed to implement the changes necessary to make healthcare more comprehensive? 

6. Cost Control - Group 6

   In health care, spending more money doesn’t always guarantee better outcomes, especially when it comes to things like reducing wait times. How are these issues portrayed in the media? 

   In your own life or work, what are some examples where you have re-organized resources to solve a problem? 

   Can you see how this approach may be helpful in health care and how so?

   What MA leadership competencies do you think would be needed to implement the changes necessary to make healthcare cost effective? 

   

Allow students 45 minutes to work in their expert groups to prepare a short presentation on their assigned challenge.  After the 45 minutes, each expert group member will be assigned to a new group for round 2 (with one member from each of the 6 expert groups).  In the new groups, each expert will be given 5 minutes to present their topic to the new group.   Allow 30 minutes for the follow up presentations. 

### Participation

As the facilitator, please fill out a rubric for each student to let the instructor know about engagement and participation. This will be part of the student’s grade for this portion of the course.
