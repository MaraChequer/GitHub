# Unit 4: Leadership Opportunities

The Canadian health system needs much better leadership. In this unit, we will examine specific ideas for improving the healthcare system by addressing the importance of developing a leadership vision, changing organizational culture, examining the LEADS in a caring environment framework, and evaluating a healthcare leader. 

## Topics

1.   The Leadership Imperative 

2.   What is Organizational Culture?

3.   The LEADS in a Caring Environment Framework

#### Facilitated Learning Activity 4.1: Reflect on Your Leadership Journey

Begin this learning activity by showing the following video where Dr. Strong discusses a [Biblical Perspective on Leadership in Healthcare](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/4f430440-834f-4280-b8be-08211948c5b0)

In the video, Dr. Strong shares the Christian vision for leadership in healthcare. Next, review the following key components of a leadership vision with the class:

- A leadership vision provides a compelling story of the future that is engaging; it captures the heart, forces you to pay attention. Those who hear it want to be a part of it somehow. And they are moved.

- What does your future look like – what’s the image? If others could travel into the future with you, what would they find? A well-crafted leadership vision is described in concrete terms that are easy to visualize and remember.

- The story of your future should be a stretch, but it must be achievable, too. If it were not achievable, you would have little motivation to even bother trying.

- Finally, the future simply means some time from this moment forward, but not so far away that’s it’s out of reach.

  

  Organize the class into pairs and ask each pair to share their own vision for leadership in healthcare, specifically by answering the following questions:

1. What has your experience in healthcare been like so far?
2. What does your future in healthcare look like – what’s the image you would describe? 
3. If others could travel into the future with you, what would they find you doing? 



#### Facilitated Learning Activity 4.2: Creating a Positive Organizational Culture

For this learning activity, arrange the students into the groups that they will be working with for their group projects.  The course instructor may have some suggestions on how these groups should be organized.  Please consult with the instructor first before arranging the groups.

Ask each group to reflect on the current culture in the organization that they currently work for or have worked for in the past by answering the following questions:

1. Why do you want to change the culture? What do you want that you currently do not have? What do you currently have that you definitely want to change?
2. What value will this culture change create for the customers/patients? How will the customers/patients notice and experience this change?
3. What value will this culture change create for your team members? How will your employees and partners notice and experience this change?
4. What is the risk if you do not make this change? What would be the consequences of continuing with your existing culture?



#### Facilitated Learning Activity 4.3: Prepare for LEADS Group Project

Over the next five weeks students will be engaging in a group project during the learning labs while we work through the LEADS framework.  Your instructor will assessable the teams and provide you with the purpose. However, for a team to be truly effective, its members must unite with the same vision and be motivated to bring that vision to life. They must share clear, measurable goals, and be committed to each play their part in the overall success of the group.  The purpose of this learning activity is to develop a team charter so that everyone is committed to the work that they have to do.

Break the class into their assigned groups and ask them to develop your team charter using the following five easy steps:

1. **Start with the context**. Who is the team leader? Who is the team recorder? What does each contributor bring to the team? What are their individual expectations? Have everyone on the team write out their answers to these questions.
2. **Define your vision and objectives**. What does success look like for your team? In an ideal world, what would you like to accomplish? Create a succinct mission statement that outlines what you hope to achieve.
3. **Create deadlines, goals, and milestones**. Define roles and responsibilities. Who is doing what? For whom? What does each team member need to achieve their goal? When are the due dates?
4. **Lay out your checks and balances**. To create an effective team charter, you have to balance the aspirational with the tangible. The aspirational part of the charter is the mission statement and the vision. But it’s just as crucial to measure your progress toward your goals. Your charter should lay out the internal checks and balances that will ensure you’re reviewing everyone’s progress. How will you check in? When or how often? How will you measure success?
5. **Have everyone on the team sign off** on the charter. Many teams like to print it out and ask teammates to physically sign the paper, to symbolize their commitment.

**Submit your team charter on the shared google doc provided in Unit 4.**

### Assessment: 

### Discussion Post & Response

After completing in-class discussion activities, students should post notes and a summarizing paragraph of what they learned during the discussion activities in a Unit 4 Forum Discussion in Moodle. Students can represent their ideas in forums using prose, video, audio, slide deck with narration and/or speakers notes, or any other creative method of choice. 

### Participation

As the facilitator, please fill out a rubric for each student to let the instructor know about engagement and participation. This will be part of the student’s grade for this portion of the course.
