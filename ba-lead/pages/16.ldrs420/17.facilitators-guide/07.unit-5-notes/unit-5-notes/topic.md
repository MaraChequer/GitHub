# Unit 5: Leading Self

This unit examines the Lead Self domain of the LEADS in a Caring Environment leadership framework. A health care leader (1) is self-aware, (2) manages self, (3) develops self, and (4) demonstrates character. The underlying assumption of this framework is that effective personal leadership is associated with a set of definable skill sets or capabilities that can be learned by conscious and intentional effort. Emotional intelligence is one of the core concepts that underlie all four of the Lead Self capabilities. It underlies most components of self leadership, including: attitude, motivation, trust, influence, interpersonal communication, self-control, and problem-solving.


## Topics

This unit is divided into the following topics:

1. Self-awareness

2. Managing Self

3. Personal Growth

4. Emotional Intelligence

#### Facilitated Learning Activity 1: Developing a Plan for a Psychologically Healthy Workplace

Read the following information to the class.  This information is provided in Moodle under Assessments/Assignment 2 Group Project - Unit 5.

Working in healthcare comes with unique rewards and equally unique risks. Staff working in the healthcare sector are more likely to miss work due to illness or disability than people in all other sectors. They face higher rates of burnout, compassion fatigue and sleep deprivation that can impact their psychological health as well as the safety of their patients. A psychologically healthy workplace promotes a positive culture, can prevent stigma and discrimination and can contribute to a productive working environment.

While protecting and promoting the mental health of people in the workplace is imperative in all sectors, it has a unique role in healthcare. A major factor—in either enhancing or mitigating the creation of psychologically healthy workplaces—is the quality of its leadership. Research shows there is a direct link between effective leadership and psychologically healthy workplaces. The LEADS in a Caring Environment
Framework (LEADS) uses a common leadership language and set of desirable leadership practices that is well understood within the Canadian health sector.

Over the next five units, you will be working together as a group on a project that will demonstrate how to apply the LEADS Framework, MA Leadership competencies, and Servant Leadership characteristics to create a plan for a psychologically healthy workplaces for healthcare workers. The questions provided in the next 5 units will outline what you need to think through in order to create change.

To begin, arrange the students into the groups that they were in last week in Unit 4.  Then, in their groups their task will be acting as the executive leadership team (ELT) of a hypothetical organization.  The groups should come up with a name for their hypothetical organization and a purpose - what services do you provide?

Make sure that you review how to integrate and apply the MA Leadership competencies, and Servant Leadership characteristics into the specific LEADS plans. Use experiences and examples to demonstrate understanding of how to do this well.

#### Facilitated Learning Activity 2: Group Project Part 1: Lead Self Group Discussion Questions

Leaders need the opportunity to ‘ground’ themselves in the attitudes, beliefs, values and skills needed to be ‘authentic’ change agents. Taking this time will allow leaders to assess their capabilities to lead change towards creating and leading a workplace that respects the psychological health of its workers.

Next, using the questions below, consider as a group how to co-create a psychologically healthy workplace.

1. What is the state of my own psychological health? Do I need to seek assistance before trying to lead this initiative?
2. How motivated am I to champion this initiative? Am I willing to lead it?
3. What is my personal vision for psychological safety and wellness where I work?
4. What are my own attitudes and beliefs concerning how to deal with psychological health—or
   lack of—in the workplace?
5. What strengths do I bring to acting as a champion of this work?
6. What are my areas of vulnerability and how should I prepare to deal with them?
7. What do I need to learn to be an effective champion?
8. What aspects of my character may well be tested as I promote the vision and purpose?

**As a group, provide a short 2-3 page summary of your Lead Self plan and post your group response on your shared google doc provided.**
