# Unit 6: Engaging Others

In this unit we will be examining how engaging and connecting others is an essential element of health care leadership. Without willing, energized, and engaged followers, a leader is unable to accomplish results on any significant scale. Leaders engage others through personal influence, teamwork, communication, and through the creation and management of performance expectations. Leaders also focus on the whole organization, by providing an engaging vision and by paying attention to the health of the organization.

#### Facilitated Learning Activity: Group Project Part 2: Engage Others Group Discussion Questions

Much of what happens in an organization is a function of the informal micro-interactions between people, not just the formal interactions required by their job. Healthy, psychologically safe, and productive interpersonal relationships between workplace colleagues are critical to implementing psychologically healthy workplace practices.

To begin, arrange the students into the groups that they were in last week in Unit 5.  Then, in their groups their task will be to create a plan for a psychologically healthy workplace for their employees.  The groups are acting as the executive leadership team (ELT) of their organization.  

Make sure that you review how to integrate and apply the MA Leadership competencies, and Servant Leadership characteristics into the specific LEADS plans. Use experiences and examples to demonstrate understanding of how to do this well.

Next, using the questions below, consider as a group how to co-create a psychologically healthy workplace.

1.  Within our area of responsibility do we know the psychological health of each employee?
    How can we find out?
2.  What are the cultural values and beliefs in our workplace? How supportive—or not—are
    they of the intents of creating a psychologically safe and healthy work environment?
3.  Do we recognize situations in our workplace that detract from psychological health and
    wellness? Can we deal with them effectively?
4.  What is important for me and our team to communicate—regularly and often—and how
    best might we do it?
5.  Do we make a concentrated effort to listen deeply, and to seek out the opinions of others?
    How might we do it better?
6.  Do we resolve conflicts effectively? What approaches work best in our environment?
7.  How might we adjust our meetings to reflect greater engagement of staff, and also to focus
    on the goals of a healthier workplace?
8.  Is our leadership style conducive to achieving psychological health and wellness? What
    impact does it have?

**As a group, provide a short 2-3 page summary of your Engage Others plan and post your group response on the shared google doc provided.**
