# Unit 7: Achieve Results

Healthcare leaders do not achieve results alone. Leaders need to engage others, collaborate to set direction and strategies that are embedded in the organization, and work for acceptance of goals. They must align all of the elements of the organization—the structure, human resources and skills, and culture and values—to realize their strategies and desired outcomes. This unit explores the Achieve Results domain of the LEADS framework. This domain includes the four capabilities of setting direction; strategically aligning decisions with vision, values, and evidence; taking action to implement decisions; and assessing.

### Topics

This unit is divided into the following topics:

1. Servant Leaders Set Direction

2. Leaders Align Decisions with Vision, Values and Evidence

3. Leadership is Persuasion

4. Providing Accountability

_______

#### Facilitated Learning Activity: Group Project Part 3: Achieve Results Group Discussion Questions

What does a psychologically healthy environment look like for your organization? Work with staff at all levels to determine the desired vision for the organization as a psychologically healthy and safe environment.

To begin, arrange the students into the groups that they were in last week in Unit 6.  Then, in their groups their task will be to create a plan for a psychologically healthy workplace for their employees.  The groups are acting as the executive leadership team (ELT) of their organization.  

Make sure that you review how to integrate and apply the MA Leadership competencies, and Servant Leadership characteristics into the specific LEADS plans. Use experiences and examples to demonstrate understanding of how to do this well.

Next, using the questions below, consider as a group how to co-create a psychologically healthy workplace.

1. Who should be involved in articulating a vision statement, and desired results, for our
   workplace? Why would they be important?
2. How will we engage the appropriate people in creating the shared vision and results? What
   processes will we use?
3. What statement of vision and purpose will articulate the desired future state of our
   workplace?
4. What results—measurable results— reflect achievement of the vision?
5. How will we engage the remainder of the organization in shaping the vision and desired
   results and getting sign off? What processes will we employ?
6. Is there a willingness to commit to specific roles/responsibilities/accountabilities relative to
   realizing the vision and desired results statement by the different groups that defined them?
   If so, what are they?
7. How will we get sign-off for the desired direction and purpose re: psychological health in our
   workplace?

**As a group, provide a short 2-3 page summary of your Achieve Results plan and post your group response on the shared google doc provided.**
