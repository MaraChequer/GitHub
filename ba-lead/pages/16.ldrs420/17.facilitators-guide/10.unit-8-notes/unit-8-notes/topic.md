#### Facilitated Learning Activity: Group Project Part 4: Develop Partnerships Group Discussion Questions

In healthcare, psychological safety and wellness goes beyond individual organizational borders - because patients do! A patient’s treatment may require the services of a variety of clinicians and experts from different organizations. Differences in psychologically healthy workplaces may result in a patient receiving different levels of treatment between facilities – which then puts the burden on another organization to compensate for it.

To begin, arrange the students into the groups that they were in last week in Unit 7.  Then, in their groups their task will be to create a plan for a psychologically healthy workplace for their employees.  The groups are acting as the executive leadership team (ELT) of their organization.  

Make sure that you review how to integrate and apply the MA Leadership competencies, and Servant Leadership characteristics into the specific LEADS plans. Use experiences and examples to demonstrate understanding of how to do this well.

Next, using the questions below, consider as a group how to co-create a psychologically healthy workplace.

1. Are there important ways in which patients, family members, and citizens might contribute to our goal of creating a healthy workplace? If so, how might we engage them?

2. What eternal programs, or initiatives should be utilized to help us achieve our healthy workplace vision?

3. Once we have identified some appropriate stakeholders to work with, what are the processes that need to be established to share resources (knowledge, money, expertise, tools, techniques) in creating psychologically safe and healthy workplaces?

4. How do we maintain strong, ongoing relationships with our chosen partners?

5. What challenges will we experience in working with external organizations?

**As a group, provide a short 2-3 page summary of your Develop Partnerships plan and post your group response on the shared google doc provided.**
