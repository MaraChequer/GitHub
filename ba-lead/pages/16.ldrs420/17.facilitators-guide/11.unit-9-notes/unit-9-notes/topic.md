# Unit 9: Systems Transformation

Numerous studies, commission reports, media editorials, and professional organization reports have been calling for major reform in the Canadian health sector. Expectations for change—driven by funding pressures, demographics, public expectations, and technology—suggest that transformation to reform the health sector is both expected and required. This unit will explore the efforts that have been undertaken across Canada to prepare heath care leaders to take on the challenges of Systems Transformation.

#### Facilitated Learning Activity: Group Project Part 5: Systems Transformation Group Discussion Questions

Any organizational change takes place in a broader context. Healthcare is complex in terms of the political attention that health attracts, the number of professions involved, the number of organizations involved, and the size and variety of mandates of the organizations delivering service. A systems approach is required to appreciate the organization’s role within this complex environment.

To begin, arrange the students into the groups that they were in last week in Unit 8.  Then, in their groups their task will be to create a plan for a psychologically healthy workplace for their employees.  The groups are acting as the executive leadership team (ELT) of their organization.  

Make sure that you review how to integrate and apply the MA Leadership competencies, and Servant Leadership characteristics into the specific LEADS plans. Use experiences and examples to demonstrate understanding of how to do this well.

Next, using the questions below, consider as a group how to co-create a psychologically healthy workplace.

1. What social values and beliefs in our community, and society at large—regarding mental health and psychological health in a workplace setting—reinforce our internal efforts to implement a healthy workplace?

2. What deep-seated patterns of behaviour exist in broader society, and that are mirrored in our organization, will prevent our potential for success?

3. What methods should we use to encourage innovation within our organization, and/or stimulate creative ideas for improvement, to create change in our organization?

4. Are there examples in other health jurisdictions—other countries—where great strides have been made in creating psychologically healthy workplaces?

5. Within the many health professions themselves—either provincially or nationally--what systems, structures, and processes do they employ that will either support or prevent our efforts at creating a psychologically healthy workplace (e.g., education practices, licensing, etc.)?

6. Are there champions for change in the broader community that would support our efforts to create a psychologically healthy workplace?

7. What kinds of tools, techniques and approaches can we use to create change in a complex system? How might those approaches be used to help create psychologically healthy workplaces?

**As a group, provide a short 2-3 page summary of your Systems Transformation plan and post your group response on the shared google doc provided.**
