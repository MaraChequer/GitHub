# Unit 10: Servant Leadership in Healthcare

There are several leadership models which health care leaders can utilize. Empirical studies have shown that servant leadership is associated with several favorable employee outcomes. Servant leadership may be the best model for health care organizations because it focuses on the strength of the team, developing trust and serving the needs of patients. As servant leaders, health care employees may be best equipped to make changes in the organization and in the provider-patient relationship to improve the value of care for patients.

## Topics

This unit is divided into the following topics:

1. Servant Leadership: A Journey, Not a Race
2. Servant Leadership and Organizational Health
3. Servant Leadership in Healthcare
4. Essential Steps in Building a Culture of Servant Leadership

#### Facilitated Learning Activity 10.1: Servant Led Change Project

Picture your own workplace or locus of influence. Think about one practice you would like to change, on behalf of patients, families, or the community. Choosing either the five-domain LEADS change model, or the servant leadership approach, discuss the steps you would take to plan the change (your project).

Lead a large or small group discussion using the following questions:

1. In your context, what is the difference between the desired results and the current state of your project. How big of a change is it? 
2. What systems implications does the project have? Consequently, what change challenges (unit, department, organization, coalition, system) will you face moving from where you are now to where you want to be? 
3. Based on your understanding of the scope and breadth of those external changes, what internal personal challenges will you have to face? 
4. Based on how big the change is, who will you need to build relationships with, and why? How will you do it?



#### Facilitated Learning Activity 10.2: Servant Led Healthcare

Begin this activity by showing the following video [Servants Heart](https://youtu.be/6zc5RfQfrls)

Then lead a large group discussion using the following questions:

1. What is different about servant leadership in healthcare than other models of leadership you have been exposed to?
2. What do you like about servant leadership?  What do you not like about servant leadership?
3. As a servant leader in healthcare, what are the key questions you need to ask yourself to prepare for leading change in the organization you work in? 
4. What is it going to take for you carry out that change? 



#### Facilitated Learning Activity 10.3: Final Reflection

Use the [1-2-4-All Liberating Structure](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/)

- Begin by asking students to silently self-reflect on the following questions (1 min.):
  - What are the 2 most surprising leadership issues you discovered in this course?
  - What are the 2 most significant leadership concepts you have learned in this course?
  - What is the single most important leadership competency you have learned about in this course and how can you apply it to the organization where you are currently working or where you were last working?
  - How has this course has positively impacted your understanding and practice of servant leadership within your particular work context?
- Next, group the students into foursomes and ask them to share their thoughts on the questions asking them to note similarities and differences. (4 min.)
- Finally, bring the whole group back together and ask, “What is one idea that stood out in your conversation?” Each group shares one important idea with all. (5 min.)

### Assessment:

#### Discussion Post & Response

Students should complete the discussion post as listed in Moodle. They will share ideas during in-class discussion/presentation and summarize their learning by posting in the Unit 10 Forum Discussion in Moodle. 

### Participation

As the facilitator, please fill out a rubric for each student to let the instructor know about engagement and participation. This will be part of the student’s grade for this portion of the course.
