**Topic 1: The Action Research Process**

The action research process can be described as a series of four interwoven actions, engaged in no particular order and flowing almost seamlessly together. These actions are planning, acting, considering and acting upon the results of the action research your team has undertaken. What makes action research different from traditional research is that the process uses the team’s insights at each step to re-engage (if needed) the question and continue to solve the issue the action research initially engaged and, also, to engage other issues the action research team has generated by working together on that initial issue. Depending upon the research question, the purpose of the study, the centrality of the question to key school goals and the number of researchers involved, each of these steps can be reshaped or re-engaged.

The action research process lends itself to a spiral of steps, with a collaborative team of action researchers reflecting on each stage of the process then using their reflections to re-plan and re-engage. When the results of the first action have been studied, action researchers plan their next actions. Each reflective phase yields more information about the issue and increases the researcher’s understanding.

Sometimes teams of action researchers gather data that lead them to redefine their question or reshape their work. The most important skill a team of action researchers needs in action research is the ability to consider the **“What?”** that has been found, discuss the **“So What?”** that the data suggest for implications and further action and create a **“Now What?”** plan for re-engaging the question in ways that continue to improve teaching and learning at the site where the action research has been engaged.

## Next, read chapter 2: Introducing Action Research in Parsons et al., Engaging in Action Research. In this chapter, Parsons et al., will deconstruct major terms and concepts related to research, method, and methodology and will examine factors that influence research methodology. Take notes as you read as through the chapter.

##

## Finally, in your reflective learning journal you will keep a record of your progressive understandings that you can review at a later date. Keeping a reflective journal is keeping data about your thinking.

##  

  - Reflect on any part of action research that is unclear to you at his point.

  - How will you increase your understanding?

  - How do you think action research will help you learn more about yourself,  
    your practice, your community, and how to create and understand change?

*Note that some of these questions will be addressed in your assignment for this unit. See the Unit 2 Assessment for more details.*

**Topic 2: The MA Leadership Conceptual Paradigm**

The MA Leadership Program at Trinity Western University has an integrated foundational (Jesus) and theoretical/conceptual paradigm (transformational servant leadership) that defines the essence of the program and how it is uniquely potent in its practical study emphases and professional practice of organization leadership in individual work situations. Transformational servant leadership transcends informal relationships to include a study of leadership in organizations, with specific attention to how people are valued and empowered while also creating shared decision-making responsibility and authority over policy, program, and delivery systems, contributing to optimal organizational performance outcomes or results. Understanding the extent to which the leader is able to shift the primary focus of his or her leadership from the organization to the follower is the distinguishing factor in determining whether the leader may be a transformational or servant leader.

##### **Foundational Base: Jesus**

In Matthew's Gospel, chapter 20 beginning in verse 25 we have a clear statement of how Jesus' conception of leadership contrasted with the prevailing understandings of that day. He turned the prevailing paradigm upside-down by asserting, "Whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant" (verse 26, NASB). To further reinforce this new paradigm, Jesus pointed to himself as an example, and flatly stated, "The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many" (verse 28). John's Gospel records a graphic demonstration of this attitude—at the final meal with his disciples, Jesus removed his outer garments and, assuming the most menial of roles, washed his disciples feet (John 13: 1-17). Within a matter of hours, Jesus would fulfil the final task described in the last part of Matthew 20: 28. While the Apostle Paul was not an eye-witness of the foot-washing event, he was very familiar with the implications. In his letter to the church at Philippi, he issued this imperative: "Have this attitude in you which was also in Christ Jesus" (Philippians 2:5, NASB). Paul described in detail how this attitude was expressed in what Jesus accomplished on the cross, using emotionally charged terms such as "bond-servant" (verse 7) and "humbled Himself" (verse 8). The essence of Jesus' attitude was that his primary focus was on serving others, not self. The things he did were motivated by a care and concern for what was in the best interests of, first, his Father, and second, people around him. Thus, a primary attribute of Jesus is that he served others rather than self. Jesus was the archetypical servant, and as followers of Jesus Christ, we are admonished to exhibit the same fundamental attitude. Consequently, at the deepest levels, we as leaders must also be other-focused, not self-focused.

### Theoretical/Conceptual Base: Transformational Servant Leadership

The primary theoretical/conceptual base that underlies the Master of Arts in Leadership program can be characterized as transformational servant leadership, and the attendant values and ethics associated with transformational servant leadership. Transformational servant leadership is itself a compound term, consisting of elements of both transformational leadership and servant leadership. While there is significant conceptual overlap between the two terms, there are important nuances that differentiate them. In the Master of Arts in Leadership program, the term transformational is intended to be a modifier of the more important term servant leadership.

**TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP**

Transformational leadership is not limited to a leader transforming and influencing followers. Building from the foundation of other-focus, transformational leadership is about leaders and followers transforming each other and the collective whole. Thus, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Transformational leaders engage others, thus creating a connection that raises the level of motivation and morality. It changes and transforms all individuals, treating all as equal human beings. It moves followers to accomplish more than merely what is expected of them. Burns (1978) was the first person who built upon this theory by trying to link leaders and followers in a relationship. Transformational leaders are often visionary, charismatic leaders. Bass (1985) argued that transformational leadership motivates followers to do more than expected by raising followers’ levels of consciousness regarding goals, getting followers to transcend their own self-interest, and moving followers to address higher level needs. Transformational leadership is not merely directive. It is concerned with the performance and development of followers to their maximum potential. Such leaders often have strong internal ideas and values, and they are capable of motivating followers to act in ways that support the greater good rather than acting out of self-interest. This can also include individualized consideration, where the leader understands the unique differences of each individual and responds accordingly (Bass, 1985; Burns, 1978; Northouse, 2013). Transformational Leadership is characterized by four primary behaviors: idealized (or charismatic) influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration (Avolio, Waldman & Yammarino, 1991). According to Stone, Russell and Patterson (2004, p. 352) these functional attributes are marked by accompanying attributes as follows: Idealized influence/charisma: vision, trust, respect, risk-sharing, integrity, modeling. Inspirational motivation: commitment to goals, communication, enthusiasm. Intellectual stimulation: rationality, problem solving Individualized consideration: personal attention, mentoring, listening, empowerment

**SERVANT LEADERSHIP                                           **

Servant leadership builds upon transformational leadership. It is derived from two primary sources: the writings of Robert Greenleaf and as earlier stated, the Bible (particularly Jesus as recorded in the New Testament). Servant-Leadership is a practical philosophy which supports people who choose to serve first, and then lead as a way of expanding service to individuals and institutions. Servant-leaders may or may not hold formal leadership positions. Servant-leadership encourages collaboration, trust, foresight, listening, and the ethical use of power and empowerment**.**

**Robert Greenleaf (1977), the man who coined the phrase, described servant-leadership in this way:**

> *The servant-leader is servant first… It begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve, to serve first. Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead. He or she is sharply different from the person who is leader first, perhaps because of the need to assuage an unusual power drive or to acquire material possessions. For such it will be a later choice to serve – after leadership is established. The leader-first and the servant-first are two extreme types. Between them there are shadings and blends that are part of the infinite variety of human nature.*
>
> *The difference manifests itself in the care taken by the servant-first to make sure that other people’s highest priority needs are being served. The best test, and difficult to administer, is: do those served grow as persons; do they, while being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants? And, what is the effect on the least privileged in society; will they benefit, or, at least, will they not be further deprived*? (p.7)

In this particular course we will be synthesizing our leadership learning around the Servant Leadership principles described by Spears (2010) below.

**Note to ID: Please add some sort of icons/vectors as visual supports for these ten characteristics.**

**1. Listening: **Traditionally, leaders have been valued for their communication and decision making skills. Servant-leaders must reinforce these important skills by making a deep commitment to listening intently to others. Servant-leaders seek to identify and clarify the will of a group. They seek to listen receptively to what is being and said (and not said). Listening also encompasses getting in touch with one's inner voice, and seeking to understand what one's body, spirit, and mind are communicating.

**2. Empathy: **Servant-leaders strive to understand and empathize with others. People need to be accepted and recognized for their special and unique spirit. One must assume the good intentions of coworkers and not reject them as people, even when forced to reject their behavior or performance.

**3. Healing:** Learning to heal is a powerful force for transformation and integration. One of the great strengths of servant-leadership is the potential for healing one's self and others. Greenleaf (1977) writes, "There is something subtle communicated to one who is being served and led if, implicit in the compact between the servant-leader and led is the understanding that the search for wholeness is something that they have."

**4. Awareness: **General awareness, and especially self-awareness, strengthens the servant-leader. Making a commitment to foster awareness can be scary--one never knows that one may discover\! As Greenleaf (1977) observed, "Awareness is not a giver of solace - it's just the opposite. It disturbed. They are not seekers of solace. They have their own inner security."

**5. Persuasion: **Servant-leaders rely on persuasion, rather than positional authority in making decisions. Servant-leaders seek to convince others, rather than coerce compliance. This particular element offers one of the clearest distinctions between the traditional authoritarian model and that of servant-leadership. The servant-leader is effective at building consensus within groups.

**6. Conceptualization: **Servant-leaders seek to nurture their abilities to "dream great dreams." The ability to look at a problem (or an organization) from a conceptualizing perspective means that one must think beyond day-to-day realities. Servant-leaders must seek a delicate balance between conceptualization and day-to-day focus.

**7. Foresight: **Foresight is a characteristic that enables servant-leaders to understand lessons from the past, the realities of the present, and the likely consequence of a decision in the future. It is deeply rooted in the intuitive mind.

**8. Stewardship: **Greenleaf's view of all institutions was one in which CEO's, staff, directors, and trustees all play significance roles in holding their institutions in trust for the great good of society.

**9. Commitment to the Growth of People: **Servant-leaders believe that people have an intrinsic value beyond their tangible contributions as workers. As such, Servant-leaders are deeply committed to a personal, professional, and spiritual growth of each and every individual within the organization.

**10. Building Community: **Servant-leaders are aware that the shift from local communities to large institutions as the primary shaper of human lives has changed our perceptions and caused a send of loss. Servant-leaders seek to identify a means for building community among those who work within a given institution.

**Activity 2.2: Reflect on Questions about Your Birkman Report**

Throughout the MA Lead program you will be given opportunities to develop new understandings about yourself through various self-assessment tools. For this learning activity, you will begin by reflecting on the results of your Birkman Assessment that you completed at or just after orientation by answering the following questions: **  
**

1.  Based on your Birkman report, what new understandings about yourself—either confirming or disconfirming previously-held self-perceptions—have you gained?

2.  Based on your Birkman report, how does your personality influence your natural leadership style? What are the strengths and challenges of this to this style?

3.  If you were building a team, based upon the Birkman report, what personality strengths might you be seeking from others to build your team?

4.  How do the insights you have gained about yourself from your Birkman report connect to conceptual paradigm of Transformational Servant Leadership? What elements of this paradigm do feel you already embrace? What elements of this paradigm do you need grow in?

*Note that some of these questions will be addressed in your Discussion Forum assignment for this unit. See the Unit 2 Assessment for more details.*

**Topic 3: The MA Leadership Competencies Framework**

The Master of Arts in Leadership program is specifically designed to foster the development of personal leadership competency in terms of the eleven leadership competencies depicted in the chart below. These may be thought of in terms of three dimensions. The first two dimensions, Transformational Servant Leadership Values and Ethics and Higher Ordered Thinking and Analysis, are considered to be foundational dimensions, and both undergird and are integral to the other nine (Dimension 3). Hence, Dimension 1: Transformational Servant Leadership Values and Ethics and Dimension 2: Higher Ordered Thinking and Analysis provide a foundation and a frame for the remaining nine leadership competencies subsumed in Dimension 3. The relationship may be visually depicted as follows:

**\[ADD IMAGE HERE from: <https://www.twu.ca/leadership-ma/competency-model>**

The nine leadership competencies in Dimension 3 are not hierarchical in any way, and are numbered only for the sake of convenience. Every learner in this program is expected to graduate with skill in each and every leadership competency described here. For each learner, some competencies will be naturally stronger, and some will be weaker. Skills in these competencies will be developed over the course of the MA Lead program. Another way to view the chart above is to think of Dimension 1 as the “What,” and Dimension 2 as the “How” that undergirds the nine specific leadership competency actions embodied in Dimension 3. In terms of Dimension 1, Transformational Servant Leadership perspectives will be focused on the transformation of self, empowerment of others, and fulfilling organizational objectives in a socially responsible manner. In terms of Dimension 2, Transformational Servant Leadership principles will permeate learner’s thinking and learning processes. Here is a brief description of each of the competencies:

**Note to ID: Please add some visuals to enhance the content.**
